OpenPref is an open source implementation of European trick-taking game 
Preferans (or Preference). It is written using cross-platform Qt4 framework 
and is portable between may operating systems including Windows and major 
Unix flavours. Some information about game's rules and strategy can be 
easily found in Wikipedia.

There is an issue with OpenPref: when you exit game clicking on Close button 
in the main window, it can remain in memory. To prevent it, exit the game 
via menu Game->Quit (Ctrl-Q) or clicking on Close button in bidding window.

To run OpenPref you need QtCore and QtGui libraries (Windows package includes 
them). To compile OpenPref from source code you need also Qt4 headers and
development tools: qmake, moc, uic, lrelease.
