1. Prerequisites:

You'll need to have these libraries (with equivalent devel versions) to build OpenPref:
	QtCore4
	QtGui4

Also you need set of Qt4 build tools: 
	moc
	uic
	qmake or cmake


2. QMake build

To build OpenPref with QMake:

 $ qmake openpref.pro
 $ make

If both Qt3 and Qt4 are installed, make sure you are using QMake from Qt4! If compilation 
fails, try qmake-qt4 instead of qmake.

To generate translations:

 $ lrelease openpref.pro

By default, QMake builds executable and translations in top of source tree. It could be
run without installation. To install OpenPref system-wide, copy executable and translations
in the same folder, e.g. /usr/local/openpref, or use CMake.

3. CMake build

To build with cmake, you need cmake >= 2.4-patch 8 . You can get cmake at 
http://www.cmake.org .

There are two ways to build OpenPref with cmake: Inside the source tree or outside.
Out of source builds have the advantage that you can have builds with different options
from one source directory.

To build OpenPref out of source:

 $ mkdir build 
 $ cd build
 $ cmake ..
 $ make
 $ make install

To build OpenPref in the source directory:

 $ cmake .
 $ make
 $ make install

To change build options, you can either pass the options on the command line:

 $ cmake .. -DOPTION=value

or use the ccmake frontend which displays all options with their cached values.

 $ ccmake ..
